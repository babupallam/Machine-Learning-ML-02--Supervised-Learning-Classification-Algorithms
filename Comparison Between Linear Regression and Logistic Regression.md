## Overview of Linear Regression

### What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The goal is to predict the value of the target variable based on the input features.

### Key Concepts

- **Model Representation**: \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon \)
    - \( y \): Dependent variable
    - \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \): Independent variables
    - \( \beta_0 \): Intercept
    - \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \): Coefficients
    - \( \epsilon \): Error term (residuals)

- **Assumptions**:
    - Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.
    - Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
    - Homoscedasticity: The variance of error terms is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
    - Normality: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.

## Overview of Logistic Regression

### What is Logistic Regression?

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable is categorical with two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, true/false). It models the probability of the default class (usually denoted as 1) as a function of the independent variables.

### Key Concepts

- **Model Representation**: \( P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n)}} \)
    - \( P(y=1) \): Probability that the dependent variable is 1
    - \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \): Independent variables
    - \( \beta_0 \): Intercept
    - \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \): Coefficients

- **Assumptions**:
    - Binary outcome: The dependent variable is binary.
    - Independence: Observations are independent.
    - Linearity of independent variables and log-odds.
    - Large sample size for more reliable estimates.

## Sample Code

### Linear Regression Example

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Generating synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Independent variable
y = 2.5 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 2  # Dependent variable

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating the model
linear_model = LinearRegression()
linear_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting
y_pred = linear_model.predict(X_test)

# Model evaluation
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```

### Logistic Regression Example

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Generating synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Independent variable
y = (X > 5).astype(int).ravel()  # Dependent variable (0 or 1)

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating the model
logistic_model = LogisticRegression()
logistic_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting
y_pred = logistic_model.predict(X_test)

# Model evaluation
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
```

## Conclusion

Both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are powerful statistical models with distinct applications. **Linear Regression** is used for predicting continuous outcomes, whereas **Logistic Regression** is suitable for binary classification tasks. The choice between these models depends on the nature of the dependent variable and the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
