## 1. Introduction to Linear Models

Linear models are a fundamental class of algorithms in supervised machine learning, particularly in classification tasks. These models assume a linear relationship between the input features and the output labels, making them straightforward, interpretable, and often effective for many practical problems. This README explores four key linear models used in classification tasks.

<a name="logistic-regression"></a>
## 2. Logistic Regression

<a name="logistic-regression-overview"></a>
### Overview
Logistic Regression is a widely-used linear model for binary classification problems. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class by applying the logistic function to a linear combination of input features.

<a name="logistic-regression-mathematical-foundation"></a>
### Mathematical Foundation
The logistic function is defined as:

\[ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]

where \( z = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b \), with \( \mathbf{w} \) as the weight vector and \( b \) as the bias term.

The probability of the positive class is given by:

\[ P(y=1|\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b) \]

The model is trained by minimizing the log-loss (or cross-entropy loss) function:

\[ \text{Log-Loss} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right] \]

<a name="logistic-regression-applications"></a>
### Applications
- Medical diagnosis (e.g., predicting the presence or absence of a disease)
- Spam detection in emails
- Credit scoring

<a name="logistic-regression-advantages"></a>
### Advantages
- Interpretable model coefficients
- Probability outputs, which can be useful for decision-making
- Works well with large datasets

<a name="logistic-regression-limitations"></a>
### Limitations
- Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log-odds of the output
- Not suitable for non-linear problems unless feature engineering or transformations are applied

<a name="lda"></a>
## 3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

<a name="lda-overview"></a>
### Overview
LDA is a classification algorithm that finds a linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes. It is based on the assumption that different classes generate data based on Gaussian distributions.

<a name="lda-mathematical-foundation"></a>
### Mathematical Foundation
LDA seeks to maximize the ratio of the between-class variance to the within-class variance, thereby maximizing class separability.

The discriminant function for LDA is given by:

\[ \delta_k(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{\mu}_k - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{\mu}_k^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{\mu}_k + \log(\pi_k) \]

where:
- \( \mathbf{\mu}_k \) is the mean vector for class \( k \)
- \( \mathbf{\Sigma} \) is the covariance matrix, assumed to be the same for all classes
- \( \pi_k \) is the prior probability of class \( k \)

<a name="lda-applications"></a>
### Applications
- Face recognition
- Marketing (e.g., customer segmentation)
- Document classification

<a name="lda-advantages"></a>
### Advantages
- Computationally efficient
- Provides a clear decision boundary
- Works well with normally distributed data

<a name="lda-limitations"></a>
### Limitations
- Assumes linear separability and normal distribution of features
- May perform poorly with non-linear boundaries or if classes have different covariance matrices

<a name="perceptron"></a>
## 4. Perceptron

<a name="perceptron-overview"></a>
### Overview
The Perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks, designed for binary classification. It is a linear classifier that updates its weights based on misclassified examples.

<a name="perceptron-mathematical-foundation"></a>
### Mathematical Foundation
The Perceptron model predicts the class label as:

\[ y = \text{sign}(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b) \]

Weights are updated iteratively using the following rule:

\[ \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w} + \eta \cdot (y - \hat{y}) \cdot \mathbf{x} \]

where \( \eta \) is the learning rate, \( y \) is the true label, and \( \hat{y} \) is the predicted label.

<a name="perceptron-applications"></a>
### Applications
- Early image recognition systems
- Basic text classification
- Linearly separable problems

<a name="perceptron-advantages"></a>
### Advantages
- Simple and easy to implement
- Efficient for linearly separable data
- Forms the foundation for more complex neural networks

<a name="perceptron-limitations"></a>
### Limitations
- Cannot solve non-linearly separable problems
- Sensitive to the choice of learning rate and initial weights
- Convergence is not guaranteed if the data is not linearly separable

<a name="svm"></a>
## 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

<a name="svm-overview"></a>
### Overview
SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes. SVM can be extended to non-linear classification using kernel functions.

<a name="svm-mathematical-foundation"></a>
### Mathematical Foundation
Given a dataset of labeled examples \((\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\), SVM solves the following optimization problem:

\[ \min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 \]

subject to the constraints:

\[ y_i(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1 \]

The decision function is:

\[ f(\mathbf{x}) = \text{sign}(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b) \]

SVM can be extended to non-linear cases using kernel functions \( K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) \) that map the input space into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible.

<a name="svm-applications"></a>
### Applications
- Image classification
- Handwriting recognition
- Bioinformatics (e.g., gene expression classification)

<a name="svm-advantages"></a>
### Advantages
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Robust to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space
- Versatile, as it can handle non-linear classification with appropriate kernels

<a name="svm-limitations"></a>
### Limitations
- Computationally expensive, especially for large datasets
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., the regularization parameter \(C\) and kernel parameters)
- Less interpretable compared to Logistic Regression or LDA

| **Applications**             | Medical diagnosis, spam detection, credit scoring    | Face recognition, marketing segmentation, document classification | Early image recognition, text classification        | Image classification, bioinformatics, handwriting recognition |
| **Limitations**              | Assumes linearity, less effective with non-linear data | Assumes normality, equal covariances                 | Fails on non-linearly separable data, sensitive to learning rate | Computationally expensive, less interpretable        |


In summary, each of these linear models has its own strengths and weaknesses. **Logistic Regression** is great for probabilistic interpretations, **LDA** is powerful under

 Gaussian assumptions, **Perceptron** is a simple yet foundational algorithm, and **SVM** provides a robust approach with flexibility for non-linear boundaries. The choice of model depends on the specific problem, dataset characteristics, and the need for interpretability versus performance.
