## How to Use

To effectively utilize the implementations and resources in this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supervised-learning-algorithms.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or use the appropriate URL if the repository is hosted elsewhere.

### 2. Navigate to Algorithm Folders

Navigate into the directory of the specific algorithm you're interested in. Each algorithm has its own folder with implementation details and examples.

```bash
cd supervised-learning-algorithms
cd linear_regression
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Before running any examples, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Typically, Python dependencies are managed using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python and relevant libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks), etc., installed on your machine.

### 4. Run Examples

Each algorithm folder (`linear_regression`, `logistic_regression`, etc.) contains Python scripts demonstrating the algorithm's usage. Follow the instructions provided in the respective README files to run these examples.

For example, to run a linear regression example:

```bash
python linear_regression_example.py
```

Replace `linear_regression_example.py` with the specific Python script provided in the folder.

### 5. Explore Additional Resources

Utilize the `Resources` section in this repository's README to find links to research papers, tutorials, and recommended books/courses for deeper understanding of supervised learning concepts and algorithms.

### 6. Contribute (Optional)

If you wish to contribute to this repository by adding new algorithms or improving existing implementations, follow these steps:
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
- Make your changes and ensure all tests pass.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
