## Overview

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data to predict outcomes. This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing various supervised learning algorithms.

## Algorithms

### Linear Regression

- **Description:** Predicts continuous values based on a linear relationship between input features and target variable.
- **Implementation:** Python implementation of linear regression using NumPy and scikit-learn.
- **Usage:** How to train and evaluate a linear regression model.

### Logistic Regression

- **Description:** Models binary classification problems using a logistic function to compute probabilities.
- **Implementation:** Python implementation of logistic regression with gradient descent.
- **Usage:** Example of binary classification using logistic regression.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- **Description:** Effective for both classification and regression tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane.
- **Implementation:** SVM implementation in Python using scikit-learn.
