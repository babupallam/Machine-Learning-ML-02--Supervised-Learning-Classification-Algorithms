## Algorithms Overview

### Linear Algorithms

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - **Overview:** Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.
   - **Use Cases:** Commonly used in binary classification problems like spam detection, disease diagnosis, and credit scoring.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [Logistic Regression Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section includes code examples, model fitting, evaluation, and insights into the model's performance.

2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
   - **Overview:** LDA is a classification technique that finds a linear combination of features that separates classes. It is particularly useful when the classes have similar covariance matrices.
   - **Use Cases:** Widely used in face recognition, marketing, and medical diagnosis.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [LDA Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section provides code examples, model interpretation, and an analysis of how LDA works with different datasets.

3. **Perceptron**
   - **Overview:** The Perceptron is a simple linear classifier used for binary classification. It is the foundation of neural networks.
   - **Use Cases:** Suitable for linearly separable datasets, used in early forms of neural networks.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [Perceptron Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section includes basic implementation, learning curves, and analysis of convergence properties.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - **Overview:** SVM is a powerful linear model that finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.
   - **Use Cases:** Effective in text categorization, image classification, and bioinformatics.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [SVM Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section covers implementation, kernel trick usage, and performance evaluation on complex datasets.

### Non-Linear Algorithms

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - **Overview:** KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies a sample based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.
   - **Use Cases:** Used in recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [KNN Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section provides examples of distance metrics, k-value tuning, and analysis on high-dimensional data.

2. **Decision Trees**
   - **Overview:** Decision Trees are non-linear models that split data into branches based on feature values to make predictions.
   - **Use Cases:** Common in decision analysis, customer segmentation, and credit scoring.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [Decision Tree Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section includes tree construction, pruning techniques, and a discussion on overfitting.

3. **Random Forest**
   - **Overview:** Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
   - **Use Cases:** Effective in large datasets with many features, commonly used in finance, healthcare, and marketing analytics.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [Random Forest Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section covers feature importance analysis, model tuning, and comparison with single decision trees.

4. **Naive Bayes**
   - **Overview:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence.
   - **Use Cases:** Suitable for text classification, sentiment analysis, and spam filtering.
   - **Implementation & Analysis:** [Naive Bayes Implementation](link_to_notebook). This section includes various Naive Bayes models (Gaussian, Multinomial), implementation details, and performance evaluation on text data.
