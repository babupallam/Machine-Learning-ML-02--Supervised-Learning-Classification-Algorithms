## Introduction

Supervised classification is a machine learning task where the goal is to learn a mapping from input features to a target variable (label) using labeled training data. This repository provides implementations and examples of various supervised classification algorithms, ranging from simple linear models to complex deep learning architectures.

## Algorithms

### Linear Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression**: A regression model used for binary classification problems.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: A technique used to find the linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes.
- **Perceptron**: A simple linear binary classifier.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that works well in high-dimensional spaces.

### Non-Linear Algorithms
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: A tree-based model that splits data into branches to make predictions.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves the stability and accuracy of predictions.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**:
  - **XGBoost**
  - **LightGBM**
  - **CatBoost**
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning models that learn complex patterns in data.
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
  - **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
  - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**: Similar to LDA but assumes that each class has its own covariance matrix.

### Ensemble Methods
- **Bagging**: An ensemble method that combines multiple models to improve generalization.
  - **Bagged Decision Trees**
- **Boosting**: A method that sequentially applies weak classifiers to improve model accuracy.
  - **AdaBoost**
  - **Gradient Boosting**
- **Stacking**: An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classifiers via a meta-classifier.
- **Voting Classifier**: A simple ensemble technique where multiple models vote on the final prediction.

### Probabilistic Algorithms
- **Bayesian Networks**: A probabilistic graphical model that represents the conditional dependencies between variables.

### Instance-Based Algorithms
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)**: A prototype-based supervised learning algorithm.

### Rule-Based Algorithms
- **Decision Trees**
- **Rule-Based Classifiers**: Classifiers that use a set of rules for decision-making (e.g., OneR, RIPPER).

### Kernel Methods
- **Support Vector Machines**: Can use different kernel functions (e.g., RBF, polynomial) to classify data in high-dimensional spaces.

### Deep Learning Algorithms
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
